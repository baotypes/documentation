While TAILWIND is heavily tested and audited, bug bounties help us make the 
wallet even <span text="white">smoother and safer</span>. 

Report bugs in our Discord under the [Bug Hunting channel](https://discord.gg/EMxptbxqFb). 
We will review and award prizes based on category of the bug found, according to the 
criteria below:

| Category                | Description                                                            | Award Prize
| ----------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------| -------

| Incorrect behavior      | Wanted to do something but action does the wrong thing or does not complete it    | $100
| Failed transactions     | Failed transactions if found wallet was issue                        | $50
| Feature Request         | Any feature request that we end up building                          | $40
