# How does TAILWIND bring liquidity to your Cosmos Dapp?


# 1-Click Sign API


## Declarative Funds Move and Gas Estimation
```typescript
const signer = client.getOfflineSigner("cosmoshub");
const signingClient = await SigningStargateClient.connectWithSigner(
  RPC_URL,
  signer
);

signer.declareFundsRequired?.(
  token: { denom: "uosmo", chain: "osmosis" },
  amount: "424342",
  dst_chain: "neutron"
);

signer.declareMaxGasEstimate?.(
  400_000,
  "neutron"
);

const res = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(tx)
```

Because the funds are not there, you cannot simulate for
transaction signing. Rather, we move funds for you, and 
then estimate gas for the transaction.

The gas specified is a max gas upper bound to show your user.
There is a default gas limit that is used if you do not specify. 

Since devs would know best how much gas is needed, we allow
you to specify the gas limit.

## Utilities
Here are some utilities to use for getting data above.
