## Bringing Users to your Cosmos Dapp

While app-chains scale very well, consumers hate app-chain UX. Because
each app is on a new chain, users are required to move tokens before using
a new app. Funds are easily fragmented across chains, and IBC makes them path-dependent, 
requiring developer expertise to un-wind. 

To make things worse, each app has their own gas token. Users have to 
do 3-5 additional clicks to get requisite gas. 

<Tip>
  For example, to stake ATOM on Umee, users need to swap for UMEE gas on Osmosis, 
  send UMEE out, send ATOM out, and then go to the Dapp.
</Tip>

In the worst case, they get their money stuck and stop using your 
application altogether.

## Why Tailwind?

Tailwind enables a seamless cross-chain experience for your users. Before using 
your Dapp, users no longer have to transfer tokens. Their tokens are automatically
moved and gas provisioned before signing. 

With Tailwind, users can bring liquidity to your application in 1-click, as opposed 
to 5 or more.  

{ /*
 
## How is this Possible? 

Tailwind inspects the document that you, the developer, requested signing for, 
and automatically provision funds and gas from the document info. 

To the user, this experience is done in 1-click, but under the hood,
multiple documents are provisioned, signed, and broadcasted before the signature
for the document you requested is delivered.
