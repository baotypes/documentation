## Bring Liquidity to Your Cosmos Application
We'll go over the current UX landscape in Cosmos and why 
your Dapp will benefit immensely from integrating Tailwind.

## The Problem 

{/* I still think this section should focus on the Dapp's needs,
like wanting users and wanting to dominate. Some apps are app-chains,
and they have slightly different incentives. */}

Cosmos community has always led in blockchain architecture and vision, 
pioneering proof of stake, app-chains, CosmWasm, 
and its crown jewel, IBC.

Yet, the Cosmos user base has never been as big as other leading ecosystems, like Ethereum and Solana. Why? 

<Tip>
We believe the wallet experience is holding back crypto natives and consumers from fully experiencing the Interchain.
</Tip>

Because each app is on a new chain, users are required to move tokens before using
a new app. Funds are easily fragmented across chains, and IBC makes them path-dependent, 
requiring developer expertise to un-wind. 

To make things worse, each app has their own gas token. Users have to 
do 3-5 additional clicks to get requisite gas. 

<Tip>
  For example, to stake ATOM on Umee, users need to swap for UMEE gas on Osmosis, 
  send UMEE out, send ATOM out, and then go to the Dapp.
</Tip>

In the worst case, they get their money stuck and stop using your 
application altogether.

## The Solution

Tailwind enables a seamless cross-chain experience for your users. Before using 
your Dapp, users no longer have to transfer tokens. Their tokens are automatically
moved and gas provisioned before signing. 

With Tailwind, users can bring liquidity to your application in 1-click, as opposed 
to 5 or more.

<Tip>
  Bringing $3B+ of Interchain liquidity to your Dapp has never been easier.
  You can focus on building a great application, instead of worrying about
  cross-chain token migrations or gas provisioning.
</Tip>

{ /*
 
## How is this Possible? 

Tailwind inspects the document that you, the developer, requested signing for, 
and automatically provision funds and gas from the document info. 

To the user, this experience is done in 1-click, but under the hood,
multiple documents are provisioned, signed, and broadcasted before the signature
for the document you requested is delivered.
