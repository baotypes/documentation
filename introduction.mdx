# Move Faster with TAILWIND
Stop wasting your time with 5-10 clicks or more to source funds between chains,
to swap for gas, or waste money on unnecessary fees. 

Tailwind is designed to make experiencing 50+ chains feel like one, 
by optimally moving funds and gas automatically for users, 
reducing UX from 5-10 clicks or more, to one.
